# Localized Resources Naming Convention

Each localized resource will be composed of a KEY and a VALUE.

This is the way we define our KEY to make it consistent regardless of platform/technology

```{controlName}_{controlProperty}```

- **controlName**: is the name of UI control, it should be in camel case
- **controlProperty**: is the name of UI control propety, it shuold be in Pascal case
